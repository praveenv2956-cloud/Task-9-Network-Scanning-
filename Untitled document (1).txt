🎓 Course:
B.E. Cyber Security – 2nd Year
🎯 Objective
To perform network reconnaissance using port scanning techniques and identify open ports, services, operating systems, and potential vulnerabilities in the local network.
________________


🛠 Tools Used
* Kali Linux

* Nmap

* (Optional) Masscan

* Oracle VM VirtualBox

________________


🌐 Network Information
   * Local IP Address: 10.0.2.15

   * Network Range: 10.0.2.0/24

   * Network Mode: NAT (VirtualBox)

________________


🔎 Steps Performed
1️⃣ Host Discovery
nmap -sn 10.0.2.0/24


Result:
Active Hosts:
      * 10.0.2.2

      * 10.0.2.3

      * 10.0.2.15

________________


2️⃣ Port Scanning
nmap 10.0.2.2


Findings:
Example:
         * Port 22 – SSH – Open

         * Port 80 – HTTP – Open

________________


3️⃣ Service Detection
nmap -sV 10.0.2.2


Detected services and versions running on open ports.
________________


4️⃣ OS Detection
sudo nmap -O 10.0.2.2


Operating System detection performed successfully.
________________


5️⃣ Vulnerability Analysis
nmap --script vuln 10.0.2.2


Checked for known vulnerabilities using NSE scripts.
________________


⚠️ Risk Analysis
Port
	Service
	Risk
	22
	SSH
	Brute force attack possible
	80
	HTTP
	Web vulnerabilities possible
	445
	SMB
	May allow remote exploitation if outdated
	________________


📌 Limitations
Since the VM was running in NAT mode, the scan was limited to the virtual network only. Switching to Bridged mode would allow scanning real devices in the local WiFi network.

🎯 Conclusion
Network scanning helps in:
            * Identifying exposed services

            * Detecting potential vulnerabilities

            * Understanding attack surfaces

            * Strengthening network security

This task improved practical knowledge of reconnaissance and vulnerability assessment.
